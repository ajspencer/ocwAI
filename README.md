#MIT 6.034 Artifical Intelligence
This directory contains my notes and solutions for MIT's Artifical Intelligence class. Note, before the 8th lecture I was doing this on two seperate laptops and my dropbox ran out of storage, so the notes are pretty sketchy before that point. After that point, I think the notes are pretty solid. I think my solutions are correct, but there may be some errors. 
##Lab 0:
This lab was a pretty basic introduction to python. I did the earlier excersies but not the final project because it didn't seem that interesting, and I didn't really understand the point.
